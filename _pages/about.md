Welcome to Nikolai Rozanov's personal webpage!

* I am a PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), working in the [NLP group](https://nlp.doc.ic.ac.uk) with Dr. [Marek Rei](http://marekrei.com), researching Foundation Models, Reasoning, and AI Agents.

## Introduction

I‚Äôm an experienced research scientist, engineer, and tech entrepreneur. Most recently, I‚Äôve been a PhD researcher at Imperial College London focusing on LLMs, reasoning, and agentic behavior. Prior to this, I co-founded and led Wluper Ltd. (London-based AI startup) as CTO and Head of Research for 7 years, where I built and productionised cutting-edge AI systems and co-authored papers in top-tier venues.  

I‚Äôve led multi-disciplinary teams, secured and managed a ¬£500K Innovate UK grant, and collaborated with academic leaders such as Prof. Iryna Gurevych (former ACL president). I also advise and consult on GenAI projects ‚Äì recently leading LLM-based translation evaluation at Rask AI.  

I speak regularly at conferences (e.g. CogX 2023, Podcast Show 2024), and my goal is to bridge state-of-the-art ML research with practical applications.
